# Success-Dashboard
Final Project

Overview of Application
Coding bootcamps are not for the faint of heart, we know this. There is an overwhelming amount of new material to manage and on top of that, technology is constantly changing and you are expected to stay current on all the latest happenings. Currently, we’re managing newsletters and communications with staff in email, taking notes on our machine and storing locally, some are even using notebooks. We’re also getting articles shared via Slack, event notifications are in multiple places, we’re making to-do lists in our agenda, our calendars, or on a gum wrapper for things like homework, looking deeper into a particular topic, or completing a variety of online tutorials.

With all of this and more to track, we thought it would be great to consolidate these resources and provide sources of inspiration. We are giving students a one stop shop for tracking their to-do’s and notes as they progress through a program, while always providing something new to learn whether it be from our built-in trivia to a tech news article. In order to provide students flexibility in the tracking of their notes, they will be able to dynamically add tags and filter their notes by these at any time. They will also have the ability to expand and print their notes in the Notes Manager. Relevant local Meetups will be displayed for users in a sidebar and they will also receive some positive news for the day to say encouraged. 

Lastly, the app will be built in a modular fashion so that it can be easily tailored to different industries in the future (V2) and provide additional value in the market. Users will be asked to select their industry upon signing up so that we can gauge which markets to serve next. Users will also have the option of entering a code at the time of sign up which (in V2), would allow an admin to tailor the application and provide newsletters and notifications in one place.
